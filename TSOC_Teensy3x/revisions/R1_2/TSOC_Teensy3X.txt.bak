Revison 1.2 Notes
------------------

1) Remove Ground Strap Hole, it was confusing to the assemblers
2) Change 3.3V solder jumper to cut strap, more clear to design intent
3) Extend rear dimension of PCB and swith to 90 deg (Right Angle) Grove Connectors.
4) Correct UART Silksreen error (RX/TX printed names are reversed, the signals are okay)
5) Swap !RTS(D17) with !DTR(D20) to correct PWM pin assignment error
6) Add J3 (Analog) Grove Connector for Analog sensors
